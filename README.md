# Concept Library
A library of concepts for integration and reuse.

Concepts that are common across many domains and purposes such that they may be used as needed to federate and translate  information into a threat, risk or other domain. Also known as "Micro theories" in logic. This library provides a set of reference concepts intended for broad scale integration, federation and information sharing.

It utilizes the "Semantic Information Modeling for Federation" specification, a draft standard in progress at the Object Management Group.
Many of the concepts are derived from work on threat and risk information sharing, but the concept library is not specific to that purpose.

A web view of the concept library is available on: http://models.modeldriven.org/concepts/ConceptLibrary.html
