Dolche Upper Ontology
=====================
DOLCE : a Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering

DOLCE is the first module of the WonderWeb Foundational Ontologies Library (WFOL). In our presentation paper (download pdf), it is described using first-order logic. The specific assumptions adopted for this module are first introduced informally, along with the basic categories, functions, and relations. We then present a rich axiomatic characterization, aimed at clarifying our assumptions and illustrate their formal consequences (theorems).

Note: A basic import of Dolche into SMIF-UML is provided. Additional work is required to creat the diagrams and other resources Needed.

Dolche is developed by and licenced by the [Laboratory for Applied Ontology](http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/old/DOLCE.html)
