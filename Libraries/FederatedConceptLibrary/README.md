# Concept Library Source SMIF-UML Models
A library of concepts for integration and reuse. The federated concept library is a modular reference library that can be used directly in application models, subset or used as a mapping hub. These concepts are defined using a general and domain independent approach that makes minimal assertions as to how the concepts may be used.

Note: it is intended that the model modules be loosely coupled and separated into individual model files. All modules are currently in one model file for easier management.

Threat & Risk Conceptual Model & Ontology
=========================================

The threat-risk archive provides for public access to and comment on the candidate OMG standard for threats and risks. This specification provides a conceptual model that is the basis for vocabularies, ontologies and data structures that facilitate information sharing, federation and analytics. The specification includes mappings to "NIEM Core" and "STIX" which as XML schema for the public safety and Cyber communities, respectively.
